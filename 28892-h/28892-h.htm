that will see them as the latest&mdash;and an indestructible&mdash;widespread threat to
the workers whom they will replace. The men who will seek to alter the
status quo will be called "robot lovers" and stoned. But what happens next?</small></i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"They're</span> crazy! They're insane!
That mob outside is made up of
madmen," Jacob Clark told his
young assistant, Bill Towney.</p>

<p>"They'll be battering at the door
any minute now, sir," Towney said
nervously.</p>

<p>"But why? Why are they doing
it? My inventions have advanced
the world a hundred years. I've always
been a benefactor of man,
not a destroyer."</p>

<p>"It's the robots. People are in a
rage because they say the robots
cause unemployment by replacing
workers."</p>

<p>"It's utter nonsense, you know,"
Clark said impatiently. "Why can't
they see that my intelligent, self-controlled
robots are the greatest
boon the human race has ever received
from one man?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir, but they
don't." Towney paused as the
shouting and pounding outside became
more intense. "They demanded
that you take the robots out of
the labor market and order your
factories to stop making them. This
is the result of your refusal."</p>

<p>"DOWN WITH CLARK!
DOWN WITH THE TIN MEN!
DEATH TO THE ROBOT
LOVERS!" The furious mob was
battering at the door now.</p>

<p>"Really, sir," Towney said,
"you should leave here. They'll
kill you if you don't!"</p>

<p>"Leave here? I should say not.
I'll defy the fools. I'll tell them
what I've done for them and make
them understand." He glanced
nervously at the door. "Besides
there's only one door. I couldn't
get away now."</p>

<p>"There's the time machine, sir."</p>

<p>"But isn't there some other way?
Perhaps if you went out and talked
to them...."</p>

<p>"You know there's no other way.
Those people believe you've
brought disaster to the human race
and they mean to kill you. And
if you don't hurry they will,"
Towney said urgently. "The time
machine is set for twenty years in
the future. Please hurry, sir!"</p>

<p>The door was beginning to give.
Clark looked around unhappily and
then walked to the time machine.
"All right, I'll go. In the future I
know the results of my work will
be appreciated. I'll be a hero and
benefactor of mankind."</p>

<p>Towney heard the door crash
and roughly pushed his employer
into the time machine as the mob
burst through. "Push the starting
button, push the starting button.
Quick!" he screamed as the first of
the mob reached him.</p>

<p>Clark's hand leaped to the control
lever just as a brick crashed
into his head. His hand completed
its motion with more force than
he had intended as he sank unconscious
to the floor and the machine
was set for a thousand years in the
future instead of twenty.</p>

<hr />

<p>The year three thousand had
been a brilliant one for the robots,
in fact, the most brilliant since the
last human being had died some
five hundred years before. They had
reached Venus and Mars and were
now planning a trip to Jupiter.
And this very day, a huge statue
of Jacob Clark, the creator and
benefactor, was to be dedicated on
the site of what once had been his
laboratory. It seemed a shame that
most of the records concerning him
and his time had been lost in one
of the great wars that had helped
to extinguish the humans. The
statue though was good for surely
he looked like a robot. One of the
few human books still in existence
said that the Creator had created in
his own image.</p>

<p>It was right at the foot of his
own statue that the Guardians of
the Shrine found Jacob Clark. They
picked up his unconscious, bleeding
body and laid it tenderly on a
nearby bench. They bent over him
with all the gentleness and solicitude
that had been installed in his
very first models and had been
handed down from generation to
generation of robots. They wanted
to help him but they were very
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it came from a far part
of the earth," one of them said.</p>

<p>"Or maybe a mistake was made
at one of the birth factories," said
another. "See, it is losing oil at a
great rate."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," mused the elder, "it
is a new model. At any rate it is
a robot and has been damaged. As
our great creator taught us, he must
be aided. We will take it to the
central repair factory in the city."</p>

<p>"But," the first robot protested,
"it's awfully bulky to be carried so
far."</p>

<p>Being creatures of logic, they
thought about it for a moment and
then the elder came to a decision
that was both effective and reasonable.</p>

<p>"Since he is so bulky, we will
disassemble him for transportation
purposes," he said as he leaned
over and gently twisted off Clark's
right arm.</p>

<p>"Rather primitive and messy
construction, I'd say," said the second
robot as he tenderly unscrewed
Jacob Clark's head from his body.</p>
